# AwSW-Casual-Arson

NOTES: 
This requires MagmaLink to work, which can be found on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-magmalink), or on the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2594080243)
This mod isn’t fully compatible with Bangok (Another mod by 4onen). If you have both mods installed there are two solutions: Temporarily, uninstall Bangok, or set the NSFW toggle to off.


The point of this mod is to add some extra content to Anna’s 2nd date, including:
+ A cheeky little bit of, you guessed it, Arson!
+ Mouflons
+ Some headcanon extra backstory for Anna


Requirements: Play through Anna’s 2nd date, and a new menu will appear at the end, letting you choose between the modded and base game route.


If you have any issues, questions, feedback, or encounter any bugs, grammar mistakes etc, then DM me on Discord at Ryann1706#2372


Thanks to Kolsavdür and Dice for playtesting, 4onen for helping with hooking, and especially thanks to Kolsavdür for all the great ideas.
